# 🧠 Elevvo NLP Internship Projects

This repository contains all **8 NLP projects** completed during my internship with **Elevvo**.  
Each task explores a different Natural Language Processing (NLP) concept — from sentiment analysis to transformers — building a full **end-to-end NLP portfolio**.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Throughout this internship, I worked on a series of NLP tasks designed to strengthen my understanding of:
- Text preprocessing  
- Feature engineering with text  
- Machine learning & deep learning for NLP  
- Model evaluation and visualization  

These projects simulate **real-world NLP workflows**, helping me gain practical experience in text analytics and AI-driven applications.
